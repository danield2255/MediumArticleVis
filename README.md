# MediumArticleVis
A shiny app in R visualizing 2017-2018 data from Medium.com articles and providing some summary statistics. 

As with all shiny apps, the user can run it through RStudio, opening the app.r

The user can toggle on and off particular tags of articles on the left hand bar of the UI, and this decides which kinds of articles to consider. The user can pick from any of the three window tabs to see different visualizations. The same quantile summary stats table will remain under the visualization on each of the visual panes.
